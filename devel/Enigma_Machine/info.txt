					General Information

			     This Is A Aimulator Of The Enigma Machine
				 
			
			
	The Enigma Machine was used by the Germans as an enryption device during WW2.
	It belonged to the family of portable ciphers with rotor scramblers and reminded
	an old-fashioned typewriter. The Enigma Machine was invented by a german engineer 
	Arthur Scherbius after WW1. 
	Alan Turing and his team of matematicians cracked the ciphers of the Nazi's Enigma 
	Machine. 
	
	
	This program proveides encryption and decryption features similar to those that
	existed in the real Enigma Machine. 
	
	
	This project was prepared by Iuliia Lavine as a part of Object-Oriented Programming 
	Class at Manchester Community College.
